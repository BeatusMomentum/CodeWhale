The Engine consumes the kit through a local path dependency, with no Git
dependency and no package publication. Binary builds need only this checkout.
Publishing codewhale-tui to crates.io requires this kit version on crates.io;
that publication remains a separate release gate requiring founder approval.

Adoption is deliberately incremental: each migrated renderer deletes its
predecessor. Workflow progress and working/verification indicators use the
kit; mounted composer, dock, posture/metrics, transcript, pending input,
ocean and character remain in the Engine until their keyboard, mouse,
localization and layout contracts can move together.
